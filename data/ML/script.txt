Professor: Good morning, class! Today, we're going to dive into the exciting world of neural networks. Can anyone tell me what they already know about neural networks?

Student 1: I've heard they're inspired by how the human brain works.

Professor: Excellent start! Yes, neural networks are indeed inspired by biological neural networks. Anyone else?

Student 2: They're used in deep learning, right?

Professor: Correct! Neural networks are the foundation of deep learning. Now, let's break down the basic structure of a neural network.

[Professor draws a simple neural network on the board]

Professor: As you can see, we have input nodes, hidden layers, and output nodes. The connections between these nodes are called weights. Can anyone guess what happens at each node?

Student 3: Is it some kind of calculation?

Professor: Good intuition! Each node performs a weighted sum of its inputs, and then applies an activation function. Let's talk about a simple activation function: the sigmoid function.

[Professor writes the sigmoid function on the board: Ïƒ(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-x))]

Professor: This function "squashes" any input to a value between 0 and 1. Can anyone think of why this might be useful?

Student 4: Maybe it helps in classification problems? Like determining the probability of something?

Professor: Excellent observation! Yes, the sigmoid function is often used in the output layer for binary classification problems. Now, let's discuss how these networks learn...

[The lecture continues with more interactions and explanations about backpropagation, gradient descent, etc.]
