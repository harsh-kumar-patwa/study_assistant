Professor: Hello, class! Today, we're going to talk about responsive web design using CSS media queries. Who can tell me what responsive design means?

Student 1: It's about making websites that look good on all devices, right?

Professor: That's right! And why is this important?

Student 2: Because people use all kinds of devices to browse the web nowadays - phones, tablets, desktops.

Professor: Exactly. Now, let's look at how we can use CSS media queries to achieve this. I'm going to write a basic HTML structure, and then we'll style it responsively.

[Professor writes HTML on the board]

```html

  
    My Responsive Website
  
  
    
      Home
      About
      Contact
    
  
  
    
      Main Content
      This is the main content of the page.
    
    
      Sidebar
      This is some sidebar content.
    
  
  
    &copy; 2023 My Website
  

```

Professor: Now, let's start with our base CSS. How should we structure our layout for larger screens?

Student 3: We could use flexbox or grid to create a two-column layout?

Professor: Great idea! Let's use flexbox. Can someone suggest how we might set this up?

Student 4: We could make the main content area a flex container, with the article taking up more space than the aside.

Professor: Perfect! Let's write that out.

[Professor writes CSS on the board]

```css
.container {
  max-width: 1200px;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

main {
  display: flex;
}

article {
  flex: 3;
}

aside {
  flex: 1;
}
```

Professor: Now, here's where media queries come in. How can we adjust this for smaller screens?

Student 1: We could stack the article and aside vertically instead of side-by-side.

Professor: Excellent! Let's write a media query to do that.

[Professor adds a media query to the CSS]

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  main {
    flex-direction: column;
  }
}
```

Professor: Can anyone think of other adjustments we might want to make for smaller screens?

[The lecture continues with discussions about font sizes, navigation layout, and other responsive design techniques.]
