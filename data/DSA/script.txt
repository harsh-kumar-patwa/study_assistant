Professor: Welcome, everyone. Today's topic is one of the most fundamental sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort. Who can tell me what they know about Bubble Sort?

Student 1: It's a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they're in the wrong order.

Professor: Excellent description! Can anyone tell me why it's called "Bubble" Sort?

Student 2: Is it because the larger elements "bubble up" to the end of the list?

Professor: Precisely! Now, let's implement Bubble Sort step by step. I'll write the basic structure, and I want you to help me fill in the details.

[Professor starts writing pseudocode on the board]

Professor: Okay, we need two nested loops. The outer loop will...?

Student 3: The outer loop will run for each element in the list?

Professor: Close! It actually runs for each pass through the list. How many passes do we need?

Student 4: N-1 passes, where N is the number of elements?

Professor: Exactly! Now, what about the inner loop?

Student 1: The inner loop compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they're out of order.

Professor: Perfect! Let's write that out.

[Professor completes the pseudocode with student input]

Professor: Now, can anyone tell me the time complexity of Bubble Sort?

Student 2: Is it O(n^2)?

Professor: Correct! Can you explain why?

Student 2: Because we have two nested loops, each potentially going through n elements.

Professor: Excellent reasoning! Now, let's discuss when we might want to use Bubble Sort, despite its O(n^2) complexity...
